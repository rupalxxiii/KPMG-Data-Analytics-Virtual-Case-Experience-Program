Completed KPMG AU Data Analytics Job Simulation on Forage📣 
I successfully completed the KPMG AU Data Analytics Job Simulation on Forage, and it was an incredible learning experience! 💼🔍

During this simulation, I had the privilege of working closely with the Data, Analytics & Modelling team, where I got hands-on experience in advising a client 
on customer targeting. Here are some of the key highlights of my journey:

🔹 Completed a simulation focused on advising a client on customer targeting with the Data, Analytics & Modelling team

🔹 Assessed data quality and completeness in preparation for analysis

🔹 Analyzed data to target high-value customers based on demographics and attributes

🔹 Developed dashboards to communicate findings with visuals

I want to extend my gratitude to KPMG and Forage for providing this valuable platform for experiential learning.
